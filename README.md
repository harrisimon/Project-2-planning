# Project 2 Proposal
## Movie Logger

### Overview 
I plan to develop a movie logger app. The app will have a search which will access 'The Open Movie Database' https://www.omdbapi.com/.
Once a user has found a movie, either by searching or suggestion they can log the movie and add a comment. Suggestions will be based off of either a random selection or subselection of movies from this dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/db55ac3dfd0098a0cf96dd542807f9253a16587ff233e06baef372bccfd09942?resource=download


### Technologies Used
* Express
* Mongoose / MongoDB
* Bootstrap
* HTML + Javascript + CSS
* Morgan

### User Stories
As a user I want to be able to...
* sign up with a username and password
* log in with the username and password
* log out
* search for a movie by title
* read a plot synopsis for a movie
* see a movie suggestion based on runtime
* see a movie suggestion based on genre
* see a movie suggestion based on release day, eg today's movie
* see a random movie suggestion
* log a movie I watched
* remove a log from a movie I watched
* add comments to a movie I watched
